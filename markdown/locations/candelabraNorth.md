# Northern Candelabra

*Northern Outpost for the Communion of the Lantern King*

### Places
 - **Mesquite Arboretum**: The closest thing to a forest on this side of the Frontier. It's a testament to the grueling work of the Communion.

### People
 - **Baldr Incanes**: A conrasu older than the sand that litters the ground; they're organized, fast, and knows they're better than you.

 - **~~Illuminator~~ Baldr Bert of the Crater**: A high-performing human Illuminator, who's a shoe-in for the next Baldr. But, Bert will not leave that choice up to chance.

 - **Illuminator Cecil of the Saved child**: A self-proclaimed opportunist, he's been climbing the ranks quickly and gaining quite a substantial amount of notoriety.

*How do they live like this. The heat and the flames? Just how*
