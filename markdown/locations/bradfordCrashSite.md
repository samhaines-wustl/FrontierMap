# Captain Bradford's Crash Site

*The remains of a mystical figure falling from the sky*

### Places
 - **Bradford's Star**: A collection of metal scraps, forever burning fire, and toxic fumes. Nonetheless, the ground is holy.

### People
 - **Captain Bradford**: A peculiar elf dressed in metal robes. She was seen once, riding on a shooting star, but now she's gone.

 - **Bradfordite Lonnie McCoy**: An old human woman who say Captian Bradford with her own eyes and now tends to the site. Too bad she's blind now.

*The stars——that's the true frontier*
