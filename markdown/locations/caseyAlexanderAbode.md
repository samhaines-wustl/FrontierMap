# Casey Alexander's Abode

*A dilapidated wizard tower that's been retrofitted with silver jewelry, weapons, cutlery, and more*

### People
 - **Doctor Casey Alexander**: A retired human doctor stricked with paranoia about a supposed werewolf, even though no one in the area believes such a thing. She wears layers of silver jewelry and continues to spread anything with a drop of silver among the grounds of the tower.

*This tower nearly sparkles in the sunshine, you've never seen so much silver in one place.*
