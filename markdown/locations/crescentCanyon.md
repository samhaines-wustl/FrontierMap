# Crescent Canyon

*Inside of the moon shaped canyon are a peaceful people just trying to live day by day*

### Places
 - **Depth Charge**: Myrtle's Tavern which she keeps stocked with all the mead one could drink. The food on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.
 
 - **The Central Bank**: This old bank is the centerpiece of the canyon, containing possibly the most sophisticated safe in the Frontier.

### People
 - **Myrtle Hodges**: The old elven tavern keep, Myrtle has seen it all. Now she only wants to kick her feet up and smoke her pipe. Oh, and also serve her clients.

 - **Sheriff Nina Palmer**: Half-orc sheriff who has recently arrived from the Old World. She's eager to keep her town safe and isn't afraid to reach out for help.

 - **The Grandson of the Wind**: No one knows when the monk arrived, he's just always been here.

*Being lowered into the canyon at sunset is a sight every Frontiersmen must see*
