# Hidden Plum Grotto

*A small farm of plum trees tucked away out of sight*

### People
 - **Virgil Brown Henson**: An old elf woman, with nails for eyes. She practices future-telling by the patterns in the sand and the crust of her delicious plum pies.

 - **Bettie Henson**: A hardworking elf and wife to Virgil. She tends the orchard and defends it from the recent zombie occurrences.

*These plum pies are foretelling, a premonition of the culinary arts*
