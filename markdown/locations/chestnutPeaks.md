# Chestnut Peaks

*The main mountain range of the east, known mainly for its difficult terrain and its lack of ore deposits*

### Places
 - **Rose Monastary**: Practitioners of the Twisting Petal Stance. Their monastary stands at the top of the peaks, the limited air makes their training even harder.

*Most never get to the top. Frankly, most don't get halfway*
