# Big Stone Gulch

*The settlement for MacArthur Park's newest caravan and your home*

### People
 - **Constable P.J. Wright**: Retired military general and capable halfling leader of the town.

 - **Professor Plummage**: A nervous half-elf professor of the occult. Though he's quite knowledgeable, he's more at home in a library than a dig site.

 - **Illuminator Jacob of the Setting Sun**: Human Illuminator of the Communion. He's taken a liking to the town's grit and determination.

*It seems the crops are growing at a supernatural rate...MacArthur truly knows how to pick a location!*
