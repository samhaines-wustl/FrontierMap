# Heavy Hand Crossing

*A brining town, large inland tanks of brine are the only thing of note*

### Places
 - **Monastery of the Cask**: A coalition of monks that tend to and meditate inside of the large brining tanks.

### People
 - **Willis Malone**: A stingy dwarven tanner, who owns the biggest leather and hide operation in the Northern Frontier. If you are to strike a deal with him, make sure it's in writing.
